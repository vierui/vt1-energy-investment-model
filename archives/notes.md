platform for investments analysis of integrated energy systems

# Preparation
## Understanding
**operational optimisation**
model to optimise the daily or hourly operation of an energy system based on given conditions.

**investment optimisation** 
from operation optimisation to the _size_ of installed technologies (direction investment decisions).

**scenario analysis**
future scenarios (e.g., changing costs, load profiles)
understand their impact for investment decisions.

Emphasise 
- integrated energy systems (various energy sources + technologies)
- multi-objective optimisation (cost minimisation, emissions reduction)
- mathematical modeling
## Ideas
Commodity price modeling
- forecast commodity prices : oil, natural fas, electricity, ... (ARIMA, ML, )
- risk management (VaR, Monte Carlo ?)

Financial derivatives
- hedging (futures, options, manage price risk associated with commodities used or produced by the energy system)
- investment portfolio optimisation (physical assets and financial)

Carbon market
- carbon trading --> offsets costs from emissions or generate revenue 
- carbons taxes, emissions trading schemes

Financial feasibility
- NPV (from capital expenditures, operating costs, revenue streams,...)
- IRR
## Recommendations
### Commodity Price Forecasting and Risk Management

- commodity price forecasting model
  Use statistical techniques or machine learning algorithms to predict future prices of energy commodities (e.g., oil, natural gas, electricity).
- risk management strategies
  Evaluate the effectiveness of hedging instruments (e.g., futures, options) in mitigating price risk for energy producers or consumers.

### Financial Derivatives in Energy Markets:

- **Analyze the pricing of energy derivatives:** Study the factors that influence the pricing of futures and options contracts on energy commodities.
- **Evaluate the use of derivatives for risk management:** Assess the effectiveness of derivatives in managing price risk and volatility in energy markets.

### Portfolio Optimization for Energy Investors:

- **Develop a portfolio optimization model:** Create a model to help investors allocate their capital among various energy assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, commodities) to maximize returns while managing risk.
- **Consider factors like correlation and diversification:** Analyze how these factors impact the performance of energy investment portfolios.

### Energy-Related Financial Products:

- **Analyze the pricing of energy-linked financial products:** Study the factors that influence the pricing of products like energy-linked bonds or structured notes.
- **Evaluate the risk-return profile of these products:** Assess the potential benefits and risks associated with investing in energy-related financial products.

### Impact of Financial Markets on Energy Markets:

- **Examine the relationship between financial markets and energy markets:** Investigate how factors like interest rates, exchange rates, and investor sentiment influence energy prices.
- **Analyze the role of financial speculators in energy markets:** Assess the impact of speculators on price volatility and market efficiency.

### Consignes
1. he first objective is to build a modelling platform that can optimize the operation of a given energy system over a specified time interval and for known boundary conditions (load demand, weather profile, energy prices, etc.) Building upon this, the next goal is to extend the model in a way such that the optimisation is performed not only in terms of operation patterns, but also with regard to the ratings of the technologies that are installed in the system, that is an optimal investment decision is made concerning the hardware components featured in the model. The final objective is then to use this model for a number of different scenarios in terms of costs, load projections, etc. in order to analyse what the associated investment decisions look like.
    
2. Data search and acquisition are certainly an important part of the work you will have to perform, it will however be directly necessary only in the latter part of the work. As mentioned above, the first part consists in setting up an analytical model, so mock data can also be used for this purpose (it would help however if also the mock data were to be realistic at least in terms of order of magnitude).
## Questions
- optimisation (Y/N --> LP, MIP, etc ?)
- Several kind of data (load, technology costs, ...) -> Should I try contacting people rather than searching online only ?
