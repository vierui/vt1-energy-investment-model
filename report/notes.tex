\section{China Reinvents Itself Every 5 Years}

\subsection{Comparison with Factory Girls and Documentaries}

%The Chinese Recipe: Bold and Smart
The Persistent Culture of Copying: The documentary highlights China's unique approach to innovation, where copying is not merely imitation but a method of deep study and understanding. This practice has allowed Chinese manufacturers to rapidly improve upon existing technologies and products, driving continuous industrial evolution.


Open Source and Open Innovation: The emphasis on open-source platforms and collaborative innovation in Guangzhou's manufacturing sector showcases a shift towards more transparent and inclusive development models. This approach fosters rapid advancements and positions China as a leader in sustainable industrial practices.


Relocation and Massive Investments: The strategic relocation of manufacturing hubs outside of major cities, accompanied by significant investments, reflects China's ongoing efforts to decentralize and modernize its industrial base, ensuring sustained economic growth.
Cultural Resilience and Adaptation: The documentary underscores the adaptability of Chinese manufacturers, who not only emulate but also enhance products, suggesting a deep-rooted cultural resilience that is key to China's industrial reinvention every five years.


Trust and Collaboration with Foreign Companies: The case of Buhler in China illustrates the critical role of trust and collaboration between Chinese and foreign companies. This relationship is essential for technological exchange and innovation, particularly in a rapidly evolving market like China.


Youthful Innovation Spirit: The entrepreneurial spirit among young Chinese innovators, as depicted in the Haxlr8r segment, highlights the growing emphasis on agility and opportunism in China's business culture. This drive is crucial for staying competitive in both domestic and global markets.

%The Chinese Recipe: Bold and Smart (Q/A with the director)
Shift Towards Indigenous Innovation: The director’s emphasis on the mindset shift introduced by Xi Jinping—“We are strong and can do it ourselves”—illustrates China's growing confidence in its own capabilities. This is a significant departure from the earlier dependence on foreign technology and expertise, signaling a new phase in China’s industrial evolution where innovation is increasingly homegrown.


Tightening Controls and National Focus: The reduction in hiring foreigners and the move towards requiring Mandarin fluency among expatriates reflect a broader strategy of tightening control over foreign influence. This shift can be seen as part of China’s effort to assert its cultural and technological sovereignty, ensuring that its industrial growth is aligned with national priorities.


Navigating Legal and Cultural Frameworks:
Informal Approaches to Innovation: The fact that the documentary was filmed without official authorization but faced no obstacles highlights the flexible and sometimes ambiguous nature of legal and cultural enforcement in China. This informality can be seen as both a challenge and an opportunity for innovation, where rules are sometimes bent in favor of progress, allowing for greater experimentation and rapid development.


Evolving from Open Source to Private Enterprise:
Transition from Open Source Ideals to Commercial Realities: The transition of Chinese innovators from open-source projects to private enterprises, as seen in the example of Pixmoving, underscores a significant shift in China’s innovation landscape. While open-source principles helped foster a collaborative environment, the pressure to commercialize and compete in a fast-paced market has driven many to pivot towards more proprietary, profit-driven models. This shift reflects the tension between idealistic innovation and the practical demands of a competitive economy. It also creates significant challenges, such as burnout and a steep learning curve for those driving the country's technological and industrial advances.


These refined focuses provide a deeper analysis of the documentary’s content, emphasizing China’s unique approach to innovation, the role of informal practices in fostering creativity, and the evolving nature of the maker movement within the context of China's economic development.


%The Other Half of the Sky
Entrepreneurial Transformation and Global Ambition: Zhang Lang’s story underscores the significant shift in Chinese entrepreneurial culture, where individuals like her not only strive to build successful businesses domestically but also aim for global expansion. Her journey reflects a broader trend of Chinese entrepreneurs leveraging international experiences to fuel domestic growth, contributing to China's continuous reinvention.


Cultural Resilience and Adaptation: The direct approach towards employment and the strong emphasis on hard work, as seen in Dong Mingzhu’s and Zhang Lang’s experiences, highlight the cultural ethos that drives China's industrial and economic evolution. This resilience and adaptability are key factors in the country's ability to transform itself every few years.


Global Learning and Local Impact: The practice of going abroad to gain knowledge and then bringing it back to benefit China, as exemplified by several of the women in the documentary, illustrates the ongoing cultural exchange that fuels China's development. This strategy is crucial for understanding how China integrates global best practices with local innovation.


Competition and Success: The pervasive competition for success, as noted in your observations, reflects the high-pressure environment within which Chinese professionals operate. This competitive spirit is a significant driver of the rapid advancements seen in regions like the Greater Bay Area (GBA), where innovation and efficiency are constantly pursued.


Self-Confidence and Globalization: The emphasis on self-confidence and the ability to navigate global markets, as taught by figures like Zhang Lang, shows how Chinese entrepreneurs are increasingly self-assured on the international stage. This self-confidence, paired with a deep understanding of cultural heritage through globalization, enables China to assert itself as a global leader in various industries.


Cultural Heritage and Modernization: The blend of maintaining cultural heritage while embracing modernity and globalization, as observed in the lives of these businesswomen, illustrates the dual forces shaping China's evolution. This balance is particularly evident in how traditional values are integrated with new, globalized practices to drive the country's ongoing reinvention.

% Factory girls 
1. Modernization and Identity
Direction: The tension between traditional rural identities and the new urban identities created by modernization.

Example from the Book:
In Chapter 7, the practice of “name-changing” illustrates how migrant workers often reinvent themselves to fit into urban environments, reflecting the broader cultural shift toward individualism in modern China.

Chapter 14 discusses how the concept of "home" evolves for these migrant workers, indicating the dislocation and the fluidity of identity as they navigate between rural origins and urban life.
Comparison with Current China:

Modern China continues to face the tension between preserving traditional values and embracing the rapid urbanization and modernization that often leads to a redefinition of personal and cultural identity. But its really mordern in the city ! More than in Europe - digital Payments, etc (i want to further speak about it)


2. Immigration and Dislocation
Direction: The emotional and social dislocation experienced by internal migrants as they move from rural areas to urban centers.

Example from the Book:
In Chapter 9, the loneliness and alienation that migrant workers feel when they return home, as they no longer fully belong to their rural past or their urban present.

Chapter 10 highlights how the past influences these workers, showing how they carry their rural identities with them even as they adapt to city life.

Comparison with Current China:
The dislocation experienced by internal migrants in China today remains a significant issue, as millions continue to move from rural areas to cities -> Less than before though ! Is it because of the Quotas fixed by the government ? (to use this question for conclusion) I guess it is often leading to feelings of alienation and a loss of cultural and familial ties but we couldnt speak with migrants -> Impossible to speak with most people so the migrants that represent this "lower" population part is even less educated (though really motivated when they have the opportunity -> Because they know how difficult it is) (cf down 3. with example 6)


3. Expectations vs. Reality
Direction: The gap between the expectations of a better life in the city and the harsh realities that migrant workers face.
Example from the Book:
Chapter 6 explores the theme of education and self-improvement, where migrant workers pursue night classes and skills training with the hope of upward mobility, often facing the harsh reality that opportunities for advancement are limited.


4. Relationships and Social Networks
Direction: The role of relationships, both romantic and platonic, in providing emotional support in a challenging urban environment.
Example from the Book:
Chapter 5 discusses the formation of “temporary families” among migrant workers, where friendships and social bonds become crucial for emotional support amidst the instability of city life.
Chapter 12 further explores the complexities of romantic relationships, which are often influenced by the harsh realities of factory work and the transient nature of urban life.

Comparison with Current China:
I guess Social networks and relationships continue to be essential for migrant workers in China, providing support in a rapidly urbanizing society where traditional family structures are often strained or absent. I did not see a lot of dates or couples outside. Also the number of declining newborn in China isn't due to the lack of migrants relationships but we see the tendency (to further develop). Same in europe or elsewhere, paradoxaly when seeking freedom and independance in a environment such as a city, it can get intimatidating or overwhelming to connect with people. Now even worse with the social medias tools where we do not ceize to compare ourselves. 


5. The Myth of Economic Progress
Direction: The myth that economic progress and modernization automatically lead to personal success and happiness.

Example from the Book:
Chapter 8 critiques the global economic forces that exploit migrant workers, revealing that the promise of economic progress often comes at the cost of personal well-being and dignity.

In Chapter 13, the aspirations of migrant workers are tempered by the harsh realities they face, showing that ambition does not always translate into success in the competitive urban landscape.

Comparison with Current China:
The narrative of economic progress in China often overlooks the personal sacrifices and struggles of those who drive the country’s growth, particularly among the working-class migrant population.
6. Comfort and Emotional Well-Being
Direction: The pursuit of comfort and emotional well-being in an environment that often prioritizes economic success over personal fulfillment.
Example from the Book:
Chapter 11 examines the importance of communication with family and friends as a source of emotional support, despite the challenges posed by distance and the pressures of urban life.
In Chapter 15, Chang reflects on the resilience and adaptability of the migrant workers, who strive to create a sense of comfort and well-being in the face of adversity.
Comparison with Current China:
The emphasis on economic success in modern China often comes at the expense of emotional well-being, as individuals navigate the pressures of urban life while trying to maintain connections with their rural roots and families (assumption here, we couldnt speak with migrants, but the fast pace, the constant control of the state, the price (eventough yet cheap for europeans - cities are expensive place to live) and comfort is else. -> Accomodations are most likely to be small -> Proof (I assume) of people always hanging their clothes outside because no space inside. 




\subsection{Greater Bay Area (GBA)}
Key Themes:
1. Historical Context and Economic Evolution
Leadership Transitions: Historical shifts from Chiang Kai-shek, Mao, and Xiaoping laid the foundation for China’s economic policies, with Deng Xiaoping’s reforms in 1979 marking the start of China’s economic opening and market-oriented development.
Economic Reforms: The shift from a planned economy to a “socialist market economy” between 1978 and 1992 allowed enterprises to be driven by supply and demand rather than government allocations. Shenzhen emerged as the focal point of these reforms, symbolizing China's modernization and economic rise.
2. Opening-Up Policy and Global Impact
Opening Policy Outcomes: China’s open-door policy has been central to its rise as the second-largest economy globally. This policy has allowed China to become an essential part of global trade through membership in organizations like the WTO and participation in agreements like the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership).
Results of Economic Growth: Over three decades, China’s GDP grew at an average of 9\% per year (1978-2008), leading to an enormous economic transformation. Urbanization surged, with migration peaking at 250 million people annually before stabilizing in 2010.
3. Economic Challenges and Opportunities
Current Economic Challenges:
Shrinking consumer demand, weakened real estate markets, and disruptions in the global supply chain due to geopolitical tensions (especially with the US) and rising commodity prices.
Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) and confidence levels are declining, signaling weak economic expectations.
Opportunities for Growth:

\subsection{Cultural Aspects and Their Impact}
 Cultural differencies are stronger implemented in China than in Taiwan where the western lifestyle is way more present. I might be biased by the chinese cultural aspect rather than taiwenese since it was less striking. It is well know that the Asian culture is way different than the western one and the Inglehart-Welzel culture map shows it well :
        
        [photo of inglehart map]
        
        Asia is known for its low individualism which is increased with poorness or religion followers (and so is socialism) and "high power distance" which means that there's less resistance in general. whereas complete opposite in Europe : High individualism and . Here are some of the key differences between the east and the west. 
        
        [tableau summary]
        
        Others aspects mark the culture though. Their lack of english knowledge is a huge barrier to the export/import of interest about the outside world beside mainland china. We coould see that they are indeed super curious and interested and are actually not that shy with us despite not being understood. The huge internet ban they must be for something, nowadays most of our information is coming from internet. With a limited access designed to a state controled allowed websites only, it's difficult to obtain other informations and hence learn any new language out of interest. Its not needed everything is in english. 
        
        All this made them all aim at being the bests. As discussed before they see copying a good thing because they meticulously copy but end up improving it. It shows their dtermination. They are determinated and have been their through their whole history, specially with their race to the leading world most powerful country with the us. The mindset seems to be in the people. From BYD who floods the western market to the emerging brands that bring cutting edge technologies chinese want to prove that they are no longer cheap but the leading manufacturers and hence the best ones. To do so they work in 
        
        An important point to keep in mind is : in China they are service oriented but on top of it in china longer means better because "more" -Y this require to adapt expectections and adjust for environments. Companies have to take it into account when dealing in China. 


\subsection{Approach for Swiss Companies}
I now have to write about the following subsection : 

The received guidelines : 
General considerations about how a Swiss company should approach business relationships with the two areas


My notes 
Culture is different in two countries and so is the business approach. But In Asia in general, we have to consider that  people is oriented towards low individualism and high-power distance. mostly the boss Is highly considered. 

In china a real difficulty lies in the communication - Most of the times a translator is assigned and he/she can make to whole business go wrong or to success. The translator can be key. We have seen this through the trip also when giving gifts to the people of the company we leading with it is necessary to give a different gift given their hierarchy status. 

In asia and mostly in china it can be strongly recommended to visit the supplier facilities and equipment, they might not exist. Quality standards are really different given the industry but expect/assume the supplier of your supplier to take the worse possible quality. Even if this thend to change, high quality is mostly for export. 


Overall cultural impact can be a huge challenge and difference, they have an other sense of punctuality, everything in their life is made through the relationships they have. Sometimes these differences can be an advantage e.g. they embrace change more easily than us they have an other approach on problem solving which can lead to new ideas. when disscussing with them. 

In Taiwan, again their proximity and the integration, with the western makes it easier. Sure theses asian cultural aspects need to be taken to accoutn but they are way less in the extremes of it which tend to not be in our culture.
