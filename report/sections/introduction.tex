1.1 Context and Motivation
The transition towards renewable energy sources has introduced new challenges in power system planning. Unlike traditional power plants, renewable sources such as solar and wind exhibit variable generation patterns, requiring more sophisticated analysis tools. Additionally, the geographic distribution of these resources often necessitates careful consideration of grid topology and transmission constraints. These factors, combined with the significant capital investments required, make it crucial to have robust analytical tools for investment decision-making.
1.2 Problem Statement
The core challenge addressed in this project is the development of a comprehensive platform that can:
Optimize power flow across a given grid topology
Evaluate multiple investment scenarios simultaneously
Consider seasonal variations in both generation and demand
Account for various types of electrical assets (conventional generation, renewables, storage)
Provide economic analysis through NPV and annuity calculations
Deliver automated, AI-enhanced interpretation of results
1.3 Project Objectives
This project aims to create an integrated platform that combines power system analysis with investment evaluation. The specific objectives include:
Development of a flexible scenario definition system that allows users to specify different investment cases
Implementation of a DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) solver to determine optimal dispatch of generation assets
Integration of seasonal analysis capabilities to account for varying generation and demand patterns
4. Creation of an automated reporting system enhanced by AI-powered analysis
Development of comparative analysis tools to evaluate different investment scenarios
1.4 Solution Overview
The developed platform integrates several key components:
A Python-based DCOPF solver using the PuLP optimization library
A scenario management system using standardized CSV formats
Seasonal analysis capabilities for comprehensive yearly evaluation
Automated report generation with AI-enhanced insights
Economic analysis tools for investment evaluation
This solution uniquely combines power system optimization with investment analysis, providing a comprehensive tool for decision-makers in the energy sector.
