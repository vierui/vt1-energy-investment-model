\begin{abstract}
This project presents a platform for investment analysis in energy systems, focusing on the
optimization of asset management through linear programming techniques. The framework integrates
DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) for network analysis with economic evaluation methods to support 
investment decisions in energy infrastructure.

The platform, implemented in Python, combines power system modeling with financial analysis tools to
evaluate different investment scenarios. It features automated scenario generation, optimization of
operational costs, and AI-assisted analysis of results. The methodology incorporates both technical
constraints from power system operations and financial metrics such as Net Present Value (NPV) to
provide comprehensive decision support.

Key features include modular architecture for extensibility, integration with industry-standard
optimization solvers, and a flexible scenario analysis framework. The platform demonstrates practical
 applicability through case studies in energy infrastructure investment, showing how it can be used
 to evaluate complex investment decisions while considering both technical and economic factors.
