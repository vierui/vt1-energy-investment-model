# Energy Investment Optimization Model

## Overview

This project tackles a critical challenge at the intersection of energy systems engineering and investment strategy:
How can we design and operate future power systems that are both technically sound and economically viable?

The model I developed answers this by combining:
	‚Ä¢	Hourly power flow optimization to simulate grid operations using Linear Programming (LP).
	‚Ä¢	Financial evaluation of renewable and storage assets using Net Present Value (NPV) and Annuities.

It‚Äôs a decision-support tool built for evaluating energy investment scenarios‚Äîwhether for national infrastructure, regional grids, or local microgrids.

## What the Model Can Do

At a glance:
	‚Ä¢	Simulates realistic grid behavior hour-by-hour.
	‚Ä¢	Optimizes generation and storage dispatch to minimize cost.
	‚Ä¢	Compares long-term economic outcomes across different technology mixes.
	‚Ä¢	Outputs clear visual and analytical reports, with optional AI-powered commentary.

This allows users to explore ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù strategies like:
	‚Ä¢	Adding batteries to stabilize solar-heavy grids.
	‚Ä¢	Testing nuclear versus gas baseload performance.
	‚Ä¢	Scaling renewables based on demand forecasts.

## Key Features
	1.	DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF):
Uses LP to compute the lowest-cost electricity dispatch, respecting:
	‚Ä¢	Generator limits
	‚Ä¢	Line capacities
	‚Ä¢	Storage constraints
	2.	Scenario-Based Analysis:
Modular setup enables batch comparison of different generation/storage portfolios, load shapes, and locations.
	3.	Integrated Techno-Economic Metrics:
Computes:
	‚Ä¢	NPV over 10, 20, and 30 years
	‚Ä¢	Annualized cost (annuity)
	‚Ä¢	CAPEX, OPEX breakdowns
	4.	Renewables & Storage Modeling:
Captures solar/wind variability, round-trip efficiency, and battery behavior over time.
	5.	Automated Reporting & Visualization:
	‚Ä¢	Markdown reports for each scenario
	‚Ä¢	Comparative charts for dispatch, generation mix, and financials
	‚Ä¢	Optional AI insights on performance trade-offs

‚∏ª

## How It Works

1. Configure Input Data
	‚Ä¢	Grid topology: branch.csv, bus.csv (MATPOWER-style)
	‚Ä¢	Generators/load profiles: master_gen.csv, master_load.csv
	‚Ä¢	Scenario parameters: scenarios_parameters.csv

2. Run Optimization
	‚Ä¢	Solver: PuLP with CBC backend
	‚Ä¢	Script: dcopf.py

3. Perform Investment Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Script: create_master_invest.py
	‚Ä¢	Inputs: CAPEX, OPEX, lifetime, discount rate

4. Generate Outputs
	‚Ä¢	Reports: scenario-wise .md reports
	‚Ä¢	Plots: seasonal generation, cost breakdowns
	‚Ä¢	(Optional) Run scenario_critic.py for AI-driven summaries

## Example Use Cases

### Individual Scenario:
	‚Ä¢	Dispatch & generation visualizations
	‚Ä¢	Economic evaluation of wind + solar + nuclear + storage
	‚Ä¢	Example:
Scenario 5 analysis

### Multi-Scenario Comparison:
	‚Ä¢	Sorts best-performing tech mixes by annuity
	‚Ä¢	Visual trade-offs across strategies
	‚Ä¢	Explore:

## How to Run the Model
	1.	Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vierui/vt1-energy-investment-model.git
    cd energy-investment-model
    ```

	2.	Install dependencies :
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

	3.	Prepare your data:
    Ensure input .csv files are in data/working/
    Configure your scenarios in scenarios_parameters.csv
	4.	Run the main script:
    ```bash
    poetry run python main.py
    ```

	5.	Explore outputs:
    Results are saved in data/results/ and report/

üß© Customization & Extension

Designed as a flexible framework for experimentation:
	‚Ä¢	Scale to any grid size (9-bus test to national-level topologies)
	‚Ä¢	Add new generation/storage technologies by editing master_gen.csv
	‚Ä¢	Adapt to future pricing models, policies, or climate scenarios
