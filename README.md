# Energy Investment Optimization Model

## Overview
This project tackles a critical challenge at the intersection of **energy systems engineering** and **investment strategy**:  
**How can we design and operate future power systems that are both technically sound and economically viable?**

The model I developed answers this by combining:
- **Hourly power flow optimization** to simulate grid operations using **Linear Programming (LP)**.
- **Financial evaluation** of renewable and storage assets using **Net Present Value (NPV)** and **Annuities**.

It’s a decision-support tool built for evaluating energy investment scenarios—whether for national infrastructure, regional grids, or local microgrids.


## What the Model Can Do
**At a glance:**
- Simulates realistic grid behavior hour-by-hour.
- Optimizes generation and storage dispatch to minimize cost.
- Compares long-term economic outcomes across different technology mixes.
- Outputs clear visual and analytical reports, with optional AI-powered commentary.

This allows users to explore “what-if” strategies like:
- Adding batteries to stabilize solar-heavy grids.
- Testing nuclear versus gas baseload performance.
- Scaling renewables based on demand forecasts.


## Key Features
1. **DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF):**  
   Uses LP to compute the lowest-cost electricity dispatch, respecting:
   - Generator limits  
   - Line capacities  
   - Storage constraints

2. **Scenario-Based Analysis:**  
   Modular setup enables batch comparison of different generation/storage portfolios, load shapes, and locations.

3. **Integrated Techno-Economic Metrics:**  
   Computes:
   - NPV over 10, 20, and 30 years  
   - Annualized cost (annuity)  
   - CAPEX, OPEX breakdowns

4. **Renewables & Storage Modeling:**  
   Captures solar/wind variability, round-trip efficiency, and battery behavior over time.

5. **Automated Reporting & Visualization:**  
   - Markdown reports for each scenario  
   - Comparative charts for dispatch, generation mix, and financials  
   - Optional AI insights on performance trade-offs


## How It Works
### 1. Configure Input Data
- **Grid topology:** `branch.csv`, `bus.csv` (MATPOWER-style)
- **Generators/load profiles:** `master_gen.csv`, `master_load.csv`
- **Scenario parameters:** `scenarios_parameters.csv`

### 2. Run Optimization
- Solver: `PuLP` with CBC backend  
- Script: `dcopf.py`

### 3. Perform Investment Analysis
- Script: `create_master_invest.py`  
- Inputs: CAPEX, OPEX, lifetime, discount rate

### 4. Generate Outputs
- Reports: scenario-wise `.md` reports  
- Plots: seasonal generation, cost breakdowns  
- (Optional) Run `scenario_critic.py` for AI-driven summaries


## Example Use Cases
### Individual Scenario:  
- Dispatch & generation visualizations  
- Economic evaluation of wind + solar + nuclear + storage  
- *Example:*  [Scenario 5 analysis](data/results/scenario_5/scenario_5_analysis.md)

### Multi-Scenario Comparison:  
- Sorts best-performing tech mixes by annuity  
- Visual trade-offs across strategies  
- *Explore:*  [Global comparison report](data/results/global_comparison_report.md)


## How to Run the Model
#### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vierui/vt1-energy-investment-model.git
cd energy-investment-model
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
poetry install
```

#### 3. Prepare your data
Ensure input .csv files are in `data/working/`

Configure your scenarios in `scenarios_parameters.csv`

#### 4. Run the main script
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

#### 5. Explore outputs
Results are saved in `data/results/` 


## Customization & Extension
Designed as a flexible framework for experimentation:
	•	Scale to any grid size (9-bus test to national-level topologies)
	•	Add new generation/storage technologies by editing master_gen.csv
	•	Adapt to future pricing models, policies, or climate scenarios
