# Scenario Analysis: Economic Efficiency and Recommendations

## Economic Efficiency of the Generation Mix
Scenario 2 presents high annual operational costs of approximately $3.2 million, predominantly attributed to nuclear energy, which accounts for the entirety of generation costs. The zero generation from solar and battery systems suggests an inefficient energy mix, yielding an ineffective blend of generation sources.

## System Composition Strengths/Weaknesses
Strengths of this scenario include the presence of nuclear energy, which has the potential for high output over extended periods. However, significant weaknesses overshadow this advantage: 
1. Solar and battery systems show no generation and negative capacity factors, indicating possible equipment failure or poor integration with the grid.
2. The complete reliance on nuclear energy without diversification leads to risk exposure from nuclear operational challenges.

## Key Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Diversification of the Energy Mix**: Increasing investments in solar and battery storage systems could enhance system resilience and paved the way for higher capacity factors.
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Rigorous analysis and monitoring of solar and battery performance should identify technical flaws, making it possible to address inefficiencies.
3. **Potential Alternatives**: Consider integrating gas as a peaking power source to balance the output and provide flexibility during low production periods from renewables. 

These adjustments can improve system efficiency and ensure a more robust energy generation strategy moving forward.
