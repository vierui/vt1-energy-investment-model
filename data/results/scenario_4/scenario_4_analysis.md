# Scenario Analysis for Scenario 4

## Economic Efficiency of the Generation Mix
The annual cost of $3,406,250.8 indicates a significant investment primarily in nuclear energy. However, the generation per asset reveals that the mix is heavily reliant on nuclear, with a substantial contribution of 681,250.2 MW. This presents a concern for economic efficiency, particularly considering the absence of output from renewable sources such as solar and wind, which typically have lower operational costs.

## System Composition Strengths/Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dominant nuclear generation provides a consistent base load, which is valuable for grid stability.

**Weaknesses:**
- Solar and wind generation are not contributing, resulting in underutilization of potential low-cost renewables. Additionally, the negative output for battery systems suggests that energy storage strategies are poorly integrated or mismanaged.

## Key Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Diversify Generation Sources:** Aim to incorporate functional solar and wind systems to capitalize on renewable energy potential and decrease reliance on nuclear.
2. **Optimize Battery Utilization:** Address the issues causing negative generation for battery systems to enhance reliability and support grid applications.
3. **Explore Operational Enhancements:** Investigate the economic feasibility of hybridizing energy generation with renewables to improve overall cost-effectiveness and reduce carbon emissions.
