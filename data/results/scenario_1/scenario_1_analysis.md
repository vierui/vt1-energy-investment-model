# Scenario Analysis Results - Critical Analysis

### Economic Efficiency of the Generation Mix
The economic efficiency of Scenario 1 is compromised by the reported operational costs of **$3,195,547.3** with a substantial portion attributed to nuclear generation. However, the generation costs for solar are **$0.0**, suggesting a possible asset underutilization or reporting discrepancy. The lack of data for gas and wind adds uncertainty regarding their contribution to both generation and costs.

### System Composition Strengths/Weaknesses
The presence of nuclear power offers a reliable baseload generation; however, the reported **0.0 capacity factor** indicates operational inefficiencies or downtime. Solar generation, while cost-effective, also shows a **0.0 capacity factor**, raising concerns over deployment or output issues. The absence of data for wind, gas, and batteries shows a lack of diversification, making the system vulnerable to outages and price volatility.

### Key Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Data Transparency**: Address gaps in data collection for gas, wind, and battery systems to evaluate their potential contributions fully.
2. **Diversification**: Incorporate a balanced mix of generation assets, focusing on renewable sources (wind and solar) and additional storage options to enhance resilience.
3. **Operational Optimization**: Investigate and mitigate the reasons behind low capacity factors for nuclear and solar to improve overall efficiency and reduce costs.
