### Critical Analysis of Scenario 1

**Economic Efficiency of the Generation Mix:**
Scenario 1 reveals a significant annual cost of approximately $3.2 million, primarily attributed to nuclear generation, which has a substantial output of 639,109.5 MW but presents a concerning cost of $3.2 million per MW. This suggests an economic inefficiency, as there appears to be a lack of diversity in the generation mix, leading to reliance on a single asset type with associated high costs.

**System Composition Strengths/Weaknesses:**
The scenario highlights a strong output from nuclear energy, yet the absence of cost-effective solar generation, with output and costs being reported as zero, raises concerns about the viability of solar integration. Additionally, the lack of data on battery storage capacity, costs, and performance indicates a significant weakness in energy storage solutions that are essential for reliability and grid stability.

**Key Recommendations for Improvement:**
To enhance economic efficiency and system resilience, there should be an exploration of integrating a balanced mix of low-cost solar and gas generation technologies. Moreover, assessing the performance and costs of battery storage systems would provide critical insights into enhancing grid flexibility and support for intermittent renewables. Implementing pilot projects or subsidies for solar and storage could drive down costs and improve system economics.
